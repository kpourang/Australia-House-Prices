<h1> Background </h1> 
<p>During Covid-19 pandemic, Australia's house prices have seen the steepest increase in almost 18 years.</p>

<p>You are a Data Analyst at the Australian Treasury and you are trying to understand the magnitude of the housing market boom by answering the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How have the Home Loan commitments ($B) been behaving compared to their 12-month averages? (use Dataset 1)</li>
<li>How does the distribution of first home buyers (#) across states in % terms for the month of March 2021 look like? (use Dataset 2)</li>
<li>How did the sales ($) accumulate in the suburb of Woodridge, QLD during the first Quarter of 2021? (use Dataset 3)</li> 
</ol>

<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>You manager was so pleased with your work that they have asked you for some additional insights:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using Dataset 1b show how loans for Travel and Holidays ($B) behaved compared to their 12-month averages</li>
<li>Using Dataset 2b show how the Australian population is distributed across states in % terms. Then compare this with the result of Question 2. Which states had a disproportionate number of loans?</li>
<li>Using Dataset 3 show the accumulation of number of sales (#) in Woodridge during Q1 for Houses vs Units. Which is more popular?</li>
</ol>
